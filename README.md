# Understanding Depression in Social Media
Sentiment analysis is a very popular technique to determine the emotional tone of text data.
In cases I have seen often, sentiment analysis was not able to capture what someone may have been feeling at a deeper level. This is especially more important in cases of mental health. Sentiment analysis is typically used for customer support, reviews, etc. With this notebook, I am looking to capture emotions felt by users online when they write text on the topic of depression.
